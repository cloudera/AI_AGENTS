# Multi-Agent API Orchestrator using CrewAI

This repository showcases the implementation of a **Multi-Agent API Orchestrator**, an advanced application powered by CrewAI. The orchestrator leverages a multi-agent collaborative framework, where multiple intelligent agents work in tandem to streamline interactions with APIs. These agents dynamically interpret user queries, process complex API Specification files such as Swagger or OpenAPI, and efficiently execute API calls tailored to the user's input.

By harnessing natural language processing capabilities, the system allows users to interact seamlessly with their services, bypassing the need for intricate technical knowledge. This innovative approach simplifies workflows and highlights how multi-agent systems can enhance API management, enabling more effective integration and automation for modern application ecosystems.

## The Technology in Action: CrewAI

**CrewAI** is an advanced multi-agent framework designed to simplify and optimize complex task execution by coordinating multiple autonomous agents. It provides a platform for defining, orchestrating, and managing agents to collaborate dynamically, each focusing on specific subtasks to accomplish overarching goals efficiently.

### Key Features of CrewAI
- **Agent Coordination**:
  - Multiple agents can be deployed simultaneously, each performing distinct roles.
  - Agents can communicate and share intermediate results for cohesive task execution.
- **Integration with APIs**:
  - CrewAI integrates seamlessly with APIs and external services, making it suitable for tasks involving data fetching, analysis, or interaction with external systems.
- **Dynamic Orchestration**:
  - Tasks are split into smaller components, and CrewAI dynamically assigns agents to these subtasks.
  - Agents adapt their behavior based on context and intermediate outcomes.
- **Scalability**:
  - Designed to handle both simple and large-scale tasks, CrewAI can scale with additional agents or resources when needed.
- **Use in Multi-Agent Systems**:
  - Supports building systems where agents analyze, validate, and act upon user inputs or system states collaboratively.

### Example Use Cases
- **API Orchestration**: CrewAI handles scenarios where user input requires multiple API calls, aggregating results to provide meaningful responses.
- **Troubleshooting Automation**: In a Kubernetes environment, CrewAI agents identify and resolve issues within pods, namespaces, or clusters.
- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Tasks such as generating reports, processing large datasets, or monitoring systems can be distributed among agents for faster execution.

### Why Choose CrewAI?
CrewAI excels in scenarios that require:
- High levels of parallelism.
- Dynamic decision-making by agents.
- Collaboration between multiple autonomous systems.

Its modular and flexible nature makes it an excellent choice for projects involving multi-agent orchestration, automation, or dynamic decision-making workflows.

## Multi-Agent API Orchestrator: Getting Started

In the application interface, you can customize the configuration to suit your specific needs. Under the **"Model Configuration Details"** section, select and configure the model you wish to use for processing your requests. In the **"Natural Language (NL) to API"** section, define the API Specifications that facilitate seamless communication between natural language inputs and their corresponding API calls. We support both **Azure OpenAI** and **OpenAI** providers, offering flexibility to leverage the capabilities of your preferred OpenAI Provider. Simply select the provider and input the required credentials.

### Model Configuration Steps
- **Azure OpenAI**: Provide the deployment name, endpoint URL, embedding deployment name, and Azure OpenAI API key.
- **OpenAI**: Provide your OpenAI API key to enable model integration.

### Natural Language (NL) to API Integration Details
- **Upload API Specification**: Upload a valid API Specification file.
- **API Endpoint**: Enter the API endpoint for the integration.
- **API Bearer Token**: Provide the bearer token to enable secure API authentication.

Once the Natural Language (NL) to API details are entered, click **Upload** to validate your inputs and initiate the orchestration process. **Streamline API orchestration** with CrewAIâ€”handle complexities effortlessly and focus on results.

## Structure and Components: The Initialization Crew

### Tools Used
1. **summary_generator**: Passes provided text to an LLM model and returns a detailed summary.
2. **generated_directory_lister**: Recursively lists the generated directory's content.

### Agent in Action
**Metadata Summarizer Agent**: Generates concise, descriptive summaries of API capabilities for all API Specification JSON files.

</div>

### Tasks and Workflow
#### When the Natural Language (NL) to API Details are Uploaded:
1. Locate the uploaded API Specification file and split it into smaller, path-specific chunks for easier management.
2. **Metadata Summarizer Task [Metadata Summarizer Agent]**: Triggers the 'summary_generator' tool to generate metadata summaries for each API Specification file. If metadata summaries already exist, no action is taken.

## Structure and Components: The Interaction Crew

### Tools Used
1. **get_human_input**: Gathers input from the user.
2. **update_env_variables**: Updates environment variables (API Endpoint/Bearer Token) on the fly.
3. **metadata_summary_fetcher**: Reads content from generated metadata summaries.
4. **api_caller**: Makes API calls using the "requests" Python library.
5. **generated_directory_lister**: Recursively lists the generated directory's content.
